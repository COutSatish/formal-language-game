# 🎮 Formal Language Recognition Game

## 📌 Overview
The Formal Language Recognition Game is a Python-based educational game designed to teach users about formal languages and their recognition. It turns abstract concepts from automata theory into interactive challenges.

Built using **Python** and **Tkinter**, the game dynamically generates languages and strings, challenges users with language membership questions, and provides instant feedback.

## 🎯 Key Features
- Difficulty Levels: Easy, Medium, Hard
- Dynamic language generation using alphabets {0,1,2,3}
- Membership checking questions with "Yes" or "No" interface
- Instant feedback and score tracking
- Retry option for replayability

## 🧰 Tech Stack
- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (for GUI)
- `random` & `messagebox` modules
